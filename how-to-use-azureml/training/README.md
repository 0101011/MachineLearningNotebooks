## Using basic training APIs

Follow these sample notebooks to learn:

1. [Train within notebook](train-withint-notebook): train a simple scikit-learn model using the Jupyter kernel and deploy the model to Azure Container Service.
2. [Train on local](train-on-local): train a model using local computer as compute target.
3. [Train on remove VM](train-on-remote-vm): train a model using a remote Azure VM as compute target.
4. [Logging API](logging-api): experiment with various logging functions to create runs and automatically generate graphs.
