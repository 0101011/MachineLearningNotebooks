## Azure Machine Learning service Tutorial

Complete these tutorials to learn how to train and deploy models using Azure Machine Learning services and Python SDK. These Notebooks accompany the tutorial article [starting here]([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/tutorial-train-models-with-aml]).

As a pre-requisite, run the [configuration Notebook](../configuration.ipynb) notebook first to set up your Azure ML Workspace. Then, run the notebooks in following recommended order.

 * [Tutorial #1](train-models.ipynb): Train an image classification model with Azure Machine Learning
 * [Tutorial #2](deploy-models.ipynb):  Deploy an image classification model from first tutorial in Azure Container Instance (ACI)
 * [Tutorial #3](auto-train-models.ipynb): Train a classification model with automated machine learning
